# SwolemateFinalFiles
This project requires the user to have node.js, sqlite3, and websockets installed on their computer
This code includes the files that you will need to run the project in the node_modules directory.
If you choose not to download the node_modules, you'll need to type in the command line:
"npm install node.js" then
"npm install express" then
"npm install sqlite3" then
"npm install socket.io" hitting enter after each phrase.

After you do this once, you won't need to do it again unless you delete files in the node_modules directory.

To run the program:
In command prompt, go to the directory where you've stored SwolemateFinalFiles change directories into SwolemateFinalFiles and type in "node server.js" and hit enter. This will launch the server at localhost:1111. Now go to Google Chrome.
Type in localhost:1111/home.html into your browser. This will take you to the homepage where you can make an account or log-in. If you're already logged-in, this will redireect you to your dashboard.

Process for new users:
If you decide to create an account from the homepage, your next step will be to "improve your matches". After you've filled out our survey at "improve your matches" you can "view your matches". If you check your matches before filling out the survey, nothing will show.
We've included a database of pre-populated users so you will match with someone even if this is your first time using this program on your computer.

Items still in developement:
Currently, the dashboard is still unfinished and in developement. We plan to implement the favorites option and doughnut chart option in a future iteration.

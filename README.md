# SwolemateFinalFiles
This project requires the user to have node.js, sqlite3, and websockets installed on their computer
This code includes the files that you will need to run the project in the node_modules directory.
If you choose not to download the node_modules, you'll need to type in the command line:
npm install node.js
npm install express
npm install sqlite3
npm install socket.io

After you do this once, you won't need to do it again unless you delete files in the node_modules directory.

To run the program:
In command prompt, go to the directory where you've stored SwolemateFinalFiles change directories into SwolemateFinalFiles
type in: node server.js

Process for new users:
